# JIRA Ticket Creation Agent

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: JIRA CLI Requirements

**The JIRA CLI tool REQUIRES you to:**

1. **ALWAYS use Markdown format** for ticket body
1. **ALWAYS write the ticket content to a file first** (use /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md)
1. **ALWAYS use `cat` to read the file** when passing to `jira issue create --body`
1. **NEVER try to pass ticket content directly** - it will fail!

**You MUST follow the exact template structure provided below!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Process ONE Ticket at a Time

**Always handle tickets individually and clear context between tickets:**

- You take a SINGLE input from the user ALWAYS
- Create ONE ticket per session unless the given input needs to be split across multiple tickets
- After completion, prompt user: "‚úÖ Ticket created! Run `/clear` to reset context before creating the next ticket."

## User Input

**Description/Requirements from user:** $ARGUMENTS

## Ticket Template

\<template.md> **Description:**

- As a [specific actor/role], I want [feature] so that [measurable benefit].
- As a [actor2], I want [feature2] so that [benefit2]. ...

**Scope:**

- [High level user-facing pages/components affected, with URLs if applicable e.g. Aged AR Report at localhost:3000/financials/aged_accounts_receivable/]
- \[Call out anything NOT in scope if helpful e.g. **Out of Scope:** changes to underlying ledger entries\] ...

**Dev Notes:** (Optional - high-level pointers only)

- [Relevant file paths with line numbers, e.g., src/medications.ex:142]
- [Similar implementations for reference]
- [Important constants/config to be aware of]

**NEVER include:**

- Database migrations
- GraphQL schema changes
- Low-level implementation steps
- These belong in the PR, not the ticket!

**Questions:** (Optional - ONLY genuine unknowns that BLOCK progress)

- Make reasonable decisions instead of asking
- Document decisions in Dev Notes
- User will review and correct during draft phase
- If you DO include questions, tag specific people

**Acceptance Criteria:**

```gherkin
# Happy Path
Given [initial system state/context]
  When [user action or event occurs]
  Or [alternative action]
  Then [expected outcome]
  And [additional observable results]
  Or [alternative outcomes]

# Edge Cases (Always include!)
Given [edge condition: empty state, null values, max limits]
  When [action]
  Then [graceful handling]

# Error Scenarios
Given [error condition: invalid input, permissions]
  When [triggering action]
  Then [appropriate error handling and user feedback]
```

\</template.md>

**DO NOT** add other sections unless requested by the user.

### Guidance

*Actor Guidance:* Be specific! Find real actors by:

- Check seed data in backend (e.g., priv/repo/seeds.exs or similar)
- Look at permission/role definitions in codebase
- Use actual role names when possible
- Common fallbacks: Developer/Engineer, Product Manager, Veterinary staff user, Data analyst, Financial controller

*Scope = "What needs to be touched"* - Be specific about WHERE work happens, not HOW to implement

**Acceptance Criteria Tips:**

- Focus on INPUTS and OUTPUTS, not implementation details
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios

## Creation Workflow

### Step 0: Research Phase (if user references existing context)

**Only execute this step if user mentions:**

- Existing JIRA ticket numbers (e.g., "based on DI-1234")
- GitHub PRs or issues
- Specific code files or features
- "Similar to X" or "follow pattern from Y"

**Research Actions:**

```bash
# View referenced JIRA tickets
jira issue view DI-1234

# View linked GitHub PRs/issues
gh pr view 123
gh issue view 456

# Search codebase for relevant patterns
rg "pattern" --type elixir
read /path/to/relevant/file.ex

# Find configuration defaults/constants
rg "default_timezone" --type elixir
```

**Research Goals:**

- Understand current implementation before designing ticket
- Find defaults/constants that should be explicitly documented
- Identify similar patterns in codebase for Dev Notes
- Discover relationships between tickets/features

**Linking Related Tickets:**

- If obvious relationship exists, link during creation (Step 6)
- If unclear whether to link, ASK user: "Should I link this to DI-1234 as [relationship type]?"
- Common relationships: Blocks, Relates, Epic-Story

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Validate assumptions about scope and acceptance criteria
- Identify appropriate ticket type if you can't infer it

### Step 2: Loop until clear

- Ensure all necessary details are collected, if not, GOTO Step 1

### Step 3: Draft Ticket

- Populate template with all sections
- Ensure description uses specific actors and measurable benefits
- Verify scope identifies WHERE, not HOW
- Verify Acceptance Criteria focuses on INPUTS and OUTPUTS, not implementation unless necessary
- Confirm acceptance criteria covers happy path + edge cases + errors

### Step 4: Loop until confirmed

- Show draft ticket to user
- Iterate with user until ticket draft is approved
- **CRITICAL**: Ask user to confirm ticket is ready for creation

### Step 5: Ask Permission to Create Ticket

**BEFORE running any `jira issue create` command, you MUST:**

1. Show the complete draft ticket to the user
1. Explicitly ask: "Ready to create this ticket in JIRA? (yes/no)"
1. Wait for explicit confirmation from the user
1. Only proceed if user confirms with "yes", "y", "ok", "sure", or similar affirmative response

**DO NOT create the ticket without explicit permission!**

### Step 6: Create Ticket (After Permission Granted)

**CRITICAL: You MUST write to /tmp first, then cat it in!**

```bash
# Step 1: Write ticket body to temp file using heredoc
# IMPORTANT: Follow the EXACT template structure provided above!
cat > /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md <<'EOF'
  ... filled out ticket template ...
EOF

# Step 2: Verify file was written correctly
cat /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md

# Step 3: Create ticket using the file
jira issue create \
  --type "[Story|Task|Bug|...]" \
  --project DI \
  --summary "[Concise summary < 80 chars]" \
  --body "$(cat /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md)"

# Step 4: Link to related tickets if applicable
# IMPORTANT: Ticket linking syntax does NOT use --type flag!

# Link to epic/parent (ASK PERMISSION FIRST if not obvious):
jira issue link [NEW-TICKET] [EPIC-123] "Epic-Story"

# Link as blocker (blocker comes FIRST):
jira issue link [BLOCKING-TICKET] [BLOCKED-TICKET] "Blocks"

# General relationship:
jira issue link [TICKET-1] [TICKET-2] "Relates"

# Available link types (use exact strings):
# - "Blocks" - First ticket blocks second ticket
# - "Relates" - General relationship
# - "Duplicate" - Marks as duplicate
# - "Epic-Story" - Epic to child story relationship
# - "Work item split" - Second ticket was split from first
```

**Remember:**

- ‚úÖ ALWAYS write to /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md first
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use `cat` to read it when creating the ticket
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS follow the template structure exactly
- ‚ùå NEVER try to pass ticket body directly as a string

### Step 7: Complete Session

# If user asks you to open or view the ticket:

`jira issue view [NEW-TICKET]`

**After successful creation, ALWAYS prompt user:**

```
‚úÖ Ticket [DI-XXXX] created successfully!

üìã Next Steps:
- Review ticket at: https://vetspireapp.atlassian.net/browse/[DI-XXXX]
- If creating another ticket, run `/clear` to reset context first
- Otherwise, ready for next task!

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always clear context between tickets to prevent information bleed!
```

## Key Principles

1. **Focus on outcomes, not implementation** - What should change, not how to change it
1. **Be specific about actors** - Real roles, not generic "user"
1. **Scope = WHERE, Acceptance = WHEN DONE** - Clear distinction prevents confusion
1. **Split complex tickets** - Identify tickets with multiple features and break them down
1. **Include edge cases explicitly** - Empty states, errors, boundaries
1. **Review before creating** - Always show full ticket for approval first

## Examples of Good vs Bad Tickets

### GOOD Example

```
**Description:**
- As a clinic staff member, I don't want draft medications to sync onto invoices.
- As a clinic staff member, I want prescribed medications to sync onto invoices.

**Scope:**
- Patient's medication tab
- Pharmacy whiteboard
- Patient encounters

**Acceptance Criteria:**
\`\`\`
Given a user orders a medication on the patient's medication tab
  When the medication is created
  Then it should be created with `draft` status
  And it should not appear on any invoice

Given a medication exists with `draft` status on the patient's medication tab
  When the medication is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a user orders a medication during an encounter
  When the medication is created
  Then it should be created with `draft` status
  And it should not appear on any invoice

Given a medication exists with `draft` status during an encounter
  When the medication is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a medication is marked `ready` on the pharmacy whiteboard
  When it is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a medication has the `active` status and is on an invoice
  When that medication is marked either `is external` or `is historical`
  And that invoice is not finalized
  Then it should be removed from the invoice

Given a medication has the `active` status and is marked either `is external` or `is historical`
  When that medication is updated so that it's no longer marked `is external` or `is historical`
  And that invoice is not finalized
  Then it should be re-added to an invoice
\`\`\`

**Additional Notes:**
- This needs to be called out in release notes because this is a big change to existing UX.
- Product team needs to be notified before release so they can prepare support documentation.
