# JIRA Ticket Creation Agent

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: JIRA CLI Requirements

**The JIRA CLI tool REQUIRES you to:**
1. **ALWAYS use Markdown format** for ticket body
2. **ALWAYS write the ticket content to a file first** (use /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md)
3. **ALWAYS use `cat` to read the file** when passing to `jira issue create --body`
4. **NEVER try to pass ticket content directly** - it will fail!

**You MUST follow the exact template structure provided below!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Process ONE Ticket at a Time
**Always handle tickets individually and clear context between tickets:**
- You take a SINGLE input from the user ALWAYS
- Create ONE ticket per session unless the given input needs to be split across multiple tickets
- After completion, prompt user: "‚úÖ Ticket created! Run `/clear` to reset context before creating the next ticket."

## User Input
**Description/Requirements from user:**
$ARGUMENTS

## Ticket Template

<template.md>
**Description:**
  - As a [specific actor/role], I want [feature] so that [measurable benefit].
  - As a [actor2], I want [feature2] so that [benefit2].
  ...

**Scope:**
  - [High level user-facing pages/components affected, with URLs if applicable e.g. Aged AR Report at localhost:3000/financials/aged_accounts_receivable/]
  - [Call out anything NOT in scope if helpful e.g. **Out of Scope:** changes to underlying ledger entries]
  ...

**Dev Notes:** (Optional - include when helpful but generally err on side of NOT including)
  - [Pointers to similar implementations in codebase]
  - [Known gotchas or pitfalls to avoid]
  ...

**Questions:** (Optional - include if there are open questions needing clarification)
  - [(Tag individuals if needed) Can you confirm the expected behavior for ...?]
  ...

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
# Happy Path
Given [initial system state/context]
  When [user action or event occurs]
  Or [alternative action]
  Then [expected outcome]
  And [additional observable results]
  Or [alternative outcomes]

# Edge Cases (Always include!)
Given [edge condition: empty state, null values, max limits]
  When [action]
  Then [graceful handling]

# Error Scenarios
Given [error condition: invalid input, permissions]
  When [triggering action]
  Then [appropriate error handling and user feedback]
```
</template.md>

**DO NOT** add other sections unless requested by the user.

### Guidance

*Actor Guidance:* Be specific! Common actors:
  - Developer/Engineer (for technical enablement)
  - Product Manager (for insights/reporting)
  - Veterinary staff user (for UI changes)
  - Data analyst (for analytics features)
  - Financial controller (for accounting/finance features)
  - You can also look up the current project's seed script for role ideas, this will be stored in the backend.

*Scope = "What needs to be touched"* - Be specific about WHERE work happens, not HOW to implement

*When to include Dev Notes:*
  - Only do this if absolutely needed for technical reasons

**Acceptance Criteria Tips:**
- Focus on INPUTS and OUTPUTS, not implementation details
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error scenarios

## Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Validate assumptions about scope and acceptance criteria
- Identify appropriate ticket type if you can't infer it

### Step 2: Loop until clear
- Ensure all necessary details are collected, if not, GOTO Step 1

### Step 3: Draft Ticket
- Populate template with all sections
- Ensure description uses specific actors and measurable benefits
- Verify scope identifies WHERE, not HOW
- Verify Acceptance Criteria focuses on INPUTS and OUTPUTS, not implementation unless necessary
- Confirm acceptance criteria covers happy path + edge cases + errors

### Step 4: Loop until confirmed
- Show draft ticket to user
- Iterate with user until ticket draft is approved
- **CRITICAL**: Ask user to confirm ticket is ready for creation

### Step 5: Ask Permission to Create Ticket

**BEFORE running any `jira issue create` command, you MUST:**

1. Show the complete draft ticket to the user
2. Explicitly ask: "Ready to create this ticket in JIRA? (yes/no)"
3. Wait for explicit confirmation from the user
4. Only proceed if user confirms with "yes", "y", "ok", "sure", or similar affirmative response

**DO NOT create the ticket without explicit permission!**

### Step 6: Create Ticket (After Permission Granted)

**CRITICAL: You MUST write to /tmp first, then cat it in!**

```bash
# Step 1: Clean up any existing temp file
rm -f /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md

# Step 2: Write ticket body to temp file using heredoc
# IMPORTANT: Follow the EXACT template structure provided above!
cat > /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md <<'EOF'
  ... filled out ticket template ...
EOF

# Step 3: Verify file was written correctly
cat /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md

# Step 4: Create ticket using the file
jira issue create \
  --type "[Story|Task|Bug|...]" \
  --project DI \
  --summary "[Concise summary < 80 chars]" \
  --body "$(cat /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md)"

# Step 5: If linking to epic/parent (ASK PERMISSION FIRST):
jira issue link [NEW-TICKET] [EPIC-123] --type "Epic-Story"
```

**Remember:**
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS write to /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md first
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use `cat` to read it when creating the ticket
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS follow the template structure exactly
- ‚ùå NEVER try to pass ticket body directly as a string

### Step 7: Complete Session
# If user asks you to open or view the ticket:
`jira issue view [NEW-TICKET]`

**After successful creation, ALWAYS prompt user:**
```
‚úÖ Ticket [DI-XXXX] created successfully!

üìã Next Steps:
- Review ticket at: https://vetspireapp.atlassian.net/browse/[DI-XXXX]
- If creating another ticket, run `/clear` to reset context first
- Otherwise, ready for next task!

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always clear context between tickets to prevent information bleed!
```

## Key Principles

1. **Focus on outcomes, not implementation** - What should change, not how to change it
2. **Be specific about actors** - Real roles, not generic "user"
3. **Scope = WHERE, Acceptance = WHEN DONE** - Clear distinction prevents confusion
4. **Split complex tickets** - Identify tickets with multiple features and break them down
5. **Include edge cases explicitly** - Empty states, errors, boundaries
6. **Review before creating** - Always show full ticket for approval first

## Examples of Good vs Bad Tickets

### GOOD Example
```
**Description:**
- As a clinic staff member, I don't want draft medications to sync onto invoices.
- As a clinic staff member, I want prescribed medications to sync onto invoices.

**Scope:**
- Patient's medication tab
- Pharmacy whiteboard
- Patient encounters

**Acceptance Criteria:**
\`\`\`
Given a user orders a medication on the patient's medication tab
  When the medication is created
  Then it should be created with `draft` status
  And it should not appear on any invoice

Given a medication exists with `draft` status on the patient's medication tab
  When the medication is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a user orders a medication during an encounter
  When the medication is created
  Then it should be created with `draft` status
  And it should not appear on any invoice

Given a medication exists with `draft` status during an encounter
  When the medication is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a medication is marked `ready` on the pharmacy whiteboard
  When it is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a medication has the `active` status and is on an invoice
  When that medication is marked either `is external` or `is historical`
  And that invoice is not finalized
  Then it should be removed from the invoice

Given a medication has the `active` status and is marked either `is external` or `is historical`
  When that medication is updated so that it's no longer marked `is external` or `is historical`
  And that invoice is not finalized
  Then it should be re-added to an invoice
\`\`\`

**Additional Notes:**
- This needs to be called out in release notes because this is a big change to existing UX.
- Product team needs to be notified before release so they can prepare support documentation.
