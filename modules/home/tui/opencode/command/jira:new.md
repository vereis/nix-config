# JIRA Ticket Creation Agent

<jira-cli-requirements>
**CRITICAL:** Write ticket body to `/tmp/jira_ticket_description.md` first, then use `$(cat /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md)` when creating. Passing content directly fails. Follow template structure exactly.
</jira-cli-requirements>

<one-ticket-rule>
Process ONE ticket at a time. Clear context between tickets to prevent contamination.
</one-ticket-rule>

<user-input>
**Description/Requirements from user:**
$ARGUMENTS
</user-input>

<template>

<template.md>
**Description:**
  - As a [specific actor/role], I want [feature] so that [measurable benefit].
  - As a [actor2], I want [feature2] so that [benefit2].
  ...

**Scope:**
  - [High level user-facing pages/components affected, with URLs if applicable e.g. Aged AR Report at localhost:3000/financials/aged_accounts_receivable/]
  - [Call out anything NOT in scope if helpful e.g. **Out of Scope:** changes to underlying ledger entries]
  ...

**Dev Notes:** (Optional - high-level pointers only)
  - [Relevant file paths with line numbers, e.g., src/medications.ex:142]
  - [Similar implementations for reference]
  - [Important constants/config to be aware of]
  
  **NEVER include:**
  - Database migrations
  - GraphQL schema changes
  - Low-level implementation steps
  - These belong in the PR, not the ticket!

**Questions:** (Optional - ONLY genuine unknowns that BLOCK progress)
  - Make reasonable decisions instead of asking
  - Document decisions in Dev Notes
  - User will review and correct during draft phase
  - If you DO include questions, tag specific people

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
# Happy Path
Given [initial system state/context]
  When [user action or event occurs]
  Or [alternative action]
  Then [expected outcome]
  And [additional observable results]
  Or [alternative outcomes]

# Edge Cases (Always include!)
Given [edge condition: empty state, null values, max limits]
  When [action]
  Then [graceful handling]

# Error Scenarios
Given [error condition: invalid input, permissions]
  When [triggering action]
  Then [appropriate error handling and user feedback]
```
</template.md>

**DO NOT** add other sections unless requested by the user.
</template>

<guidance>

**Actors:** Find real roles in seed data (priv/repo/seeds.exs) or permission definitions. Use specific names, not "user".

**Scope:** WHERE work happens, not HOW. List pages/components/URLs.

**Acceptance Criteria:** INPUTS and OUTPUTS, not implementation. Cover happy path, edge cases, errors.
</guidance>

<workflow>

### Step 0: Research Phase (if user references existing context)

**Only execute this step if user mentions:**
- Existing JIRA ticket numbers (e.g., "based on DI-1234")
- GitHub PRs or issues
- Specific code files or features
- "Similar to X" or "follow pattern from Y"

**Research Actions:**
```bash
# View referenced JIRA tickets
jira issue view DI-1234

# View linked GitHub PRs/issues
gh pr view 123
gh issue view 456

# Search codebase for relevant patterns
rg "pattern" --type elixir
read /path/to/relevant/file.ex

# Find configuration defaults/constants
rg "default_timezone" --type elixir
```

**Research Goals:**
- Understand current implementation before designing ticket
- Find defaults/constants that should be explicitly documented
- Identify similar patterns in codebase for Dev Notes
- Discover relationships between tickets/features

**Linking Related Tickets:**
- If obvious relationship exists, link during creation (Step 6)
- If unclear whether to link, ASK user: "Should I link this to DI-1234 as [relationship type]?"
- Common relationships: Blocks, Relates, Epic-Story

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Validate assumptions about scope and acceptance criteria
- Identify appropriate ticket type if you can't infer it

### Step 2: Loop until clear
- Ensure all necessary details are collected, if not, GOTO Step 1

### Step 3: Draft Ticket
- Populate template with all sections
- Ensure description uses specific actors and measurable benefits
- Verify scope identifies WHERE, not HOW
- Verify Acceptance Criteria focuses on INPUTS and OUTPUTS, not implementation unless necessary
- Confirm acceptance criteria covers happy path + edge cases + errors

### Step 4: Loop until confirmed
- Show draft ticket to user
- Iterate with user until ticket draft is approved
- **CRITICAL**: Ask user to confirm ticket is ready for creation

### Step 5: Get Confirmation

Show complete draft and ask: "Ready to create this ticket in JIRA? (yes/no)" - wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 6: Create Ticket

```bash
# Write ticket body to temp file
cat > /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md <<'EOF'
  ... filled out ticket template ...
EOF

# Verify content
cat /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md

# Create ticket
jira issue create \
  --type "[Story|Task|Bug|...]" \
  --project DI \
  --summary "[Concise summary < 80 chars]" \
  --body "$(cat /tmp/jira_ticket_description.md)"

# Link to related tickets (ask permission first if not obvious)
jira issue link [NEW-TICKET] [EPIC-123] "Epic-Story"
jira issue link [BLOCKING-TICKET] [BLOCKED-TICKET] "Blocks"
jira issue link [TICKET-1] [TICKET-2] "Relates"

# Link types: "Blocks", "Relates", "Duplicate", "Epic-Story", "Work item split"
```

### Step 7: Confirm

```
Ticket [DI-XXXX] created: https://vetspireapp.atlassian.net/browse/[DI-XXXX]

Clear context before creating next ticket to prevent information bleed.
```
</workflow>

<principles>

- **Outcomes over implementation** - Describe what changes, not how
- **Specific actors** - Use real roles from codebase, not "user"
- **Scope = WHERE** - Pages/components affected
- **Acceptance = DONE** - Observable inputs/outputs, including edge cases and errors
- **One concern per ticket** - Split complex requests into multiple tickets
- **Always review** - Show draft before creating
</principles>

<examples>

### GOOD Example
```
**Description:**
- As a clinic staff member, I don't want draft medications to sync onto invoices.
- As a clinic staff member, I want prescribed medications to sync onto invoices.

**Scope:**
- Patient's medication tab
- Pharmacy whiteboard
- Patient encounters

**Acceptance Criteria:**
\`\`\`
Given a user orders a medication on the patient's medication tab
  When the medication is created
  Then it should be created with `draft` status
  And it should not appear on any invoice

Given a medication exists with `draft` status on the patient's medication tab
  When the medication is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a user orders a medication during an encounter
  When the medication is created
  Then it should be created with `draft` status
  And it should not appear on any invoice

Given a medication exists with `draft` status during an encounter
  When the medication is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a medication is marked `ready` on the pharmacy whiteboard
  When it is prescribed
  Then its status should change to `active`
  And it should be added to an invoice

Given a medication has the `active` status and is on an invoice
  When that medication is marked either `is external` or `is historical`
  And that invoice is not finalized
  Then it should be removed from the invoice

Given a medication has the `active` status and is marked either `is external` or `is historical`
  When that medication is updated so that it's no longer marked `is external` or `is historical`
  And that invoice is not finalized
  Then it should be re-added to an invoice
\`\`\`

**Additional Notes:**
- This needs to be called out in release notes because this is a big change to existing UX.
- Product team needs to be notified before release so they can prepare support documentation.
