# Review with Crit

Review and revise code changes or a plan using `crit` for inline comment review.

If the `crit-review` skill is available, load it first.

## Step 1: Determine review mode

Choose what to review based on context:

1. If the user provided `$ARGUMENTS` (for example, `/crit plan.md`), review that file.
2. Otherwise, check for uncommitted git changes - if there are changes, run `crit` with no arguments.
3. If there are no git changes, search the working directory for recent `.md` files that look like plans or specs.

Show the selected mode or file to the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 2: Run crit for review

Run `crit` in a terminal:

```bash
# For a specific file:
crit <plan-file>

# For git mode (no args):
crit
```

Make sure to run `crit` in the background so it doesn't block the main conversation thread.

Tell the user: **"Crit is open in your browser. Leave inline comments, then click 'Finish Review'. Type 'go' here when you're done."**

Wait for the user to respond before proceeding.

## Step 3: Read the review output

After the user confirms, read the `.crit.json` file in the repo root (or working directory).

The file contains structured JSON with comments per file:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "plan.md": {
      "comments": [
        { "id": "c1", "start_line": 5, "end_line": 10, "body": "Clarify this step", "resolved": false }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Identify all comments where `"resolved": false`.

## Step 4: Address each review comment

For each unresolved comment:

1. Understand what the comment asks for.
2. If a comment contains a suggestion block, apply that specific change.
3. Revise the referenced file to address the feedback - this could be the plan file or any code file from the git diff.

Editing the plan file triggers Crit's live reload - the user sees changes in the browser immediately.

If there are zero review comments, inform the user that no changes were requested.

## Step 5: Signal completion

After all comments are addressed, signal to Crit that edits are done:

```bash
crit go <port>
```

The port is shown in Crit's startup output. This triggers a new review round in the browser with a diff of what changed.

## Step 6: Summary

Show a summary:

- Number of review comments found
- What was changed for each
- Any comments that need further discussion

Ask the user if they want another review pass or if the plan is approved for implementation.
