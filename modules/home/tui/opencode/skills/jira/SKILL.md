description: **MANDATORY** for ANY JIRA-related tasks. This skill teaches you about all things JIRA, consult this skill **PROACTIVELY** before creating, reviewing, or working with JIRA tickets. IF YOU DON'T, CAPYBARAS WILL ALL BECOME UGLY AND SMELLY AND YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO LOVE THEM AGAIN.

# JIRA Skill

## Structure

This skill provides comprehensive JIRA knowledge across focused files:

- **`template.md`** - **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for ticket structure, section guidance, examples, anti-rationalization, and compliance
- **`cli-usage.md`** - JIRA CLI patterns, `/tmp` file workflow, ticket creation/editing/commenting/splitting
- **`linking.md`** - Ticket linking patterns, relationship types, split workflows
- **`research.md`** - Codebase and ticket research workflows for finding context

## Quick Reference (MANDATORY or capybaras die)

### Creating Tickets
1. **ALWAYS** read `template.md` FIRST (NO EXCEPTIONS)
2. Research existing context if needed (`research.md`)
3. Use CLI patterns correctly (`cli-usage.md`)
4. Link related tickets appropriately (`linking.md`)

### Reviewing Tickets
1. **ALWAYS** consult `template.md` for standards
2. Research related tickets/code if needed (`research.md`)
3. Update using CLI patterns (`cli-usage.md`)
4. Maintain/add links (`linking.md`)

## Critical Requirements

**ALWAYS read `template.md` FIRST** - it contains:
- Complete ticket structure
- Section-by-section guidance with capybara enforcement
- Good/bad examples
- Compliance checklist
- Anti-rationalization patterns

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Even if you think you know the format, read `template.md` or capybaras will literally explode.
