## Daily Agenda Protocol

### 1. Discover Team Context

```bash
# Get your current user info
jira me

# Find your team members from shared projects/sprints
jira issue list --jql "sprint in openSprints() AND project in projectsWhereUserHasRole()" --assignee

# Get teammates from recent ticket activity
jira issue list --jql "updated >= -7d AND project in projectsWhereUserHasRole()" --assignee
```

### 2. Team PR Reviews Needed

```bash
# Get PRs requesting your review
gh pr list --search "is:open review-requested:@me"

# Get team PRs (discover teammates from JIRA, then check their PRs)
# For each teammate found: gh pr list --author teammate --state open

# Get PRs in your org/repos
gh pr list --search "is:open" --repo $(gh repo view --json owner,name -q ".owner.login + \"/\" + .name")
```

### 3. JIRA Status Mismatches & Actions

```bash
# Get your assigned tickets
jira issue list --assignee $(jira me)

# Check tickets in active sprint
jira issue list --jql "sprint in openSprints() AND assignee = currentUser()"

# Find tickets with recent comments/updates
jira issue list --jql "assignee = currentUser() AND updated >= -1d"

# Check for tickets where you're mentioned
jira issue list --jql "assignee = currentUser() OR comment ~ currentUser()"
```

### 4. Yesterday's Work Summary

```bash
# Your recent commits
git log --author="$(git config user.email)" --since="yesterday" --oneline

# Your recent PR activity
gh pr list --author @me --search "updated:>=$(date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)"

# Recent JIRA updates by you
jira issue list --jql "assignee = currentUser() AND updated >= -1d"
```
