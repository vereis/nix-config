## #UltraThink Analysis

1. **Requirements**: Extract exact requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints
1. **Codebase Context**: Search related code, identify affected files, check patterns
1. **Dependencies**: Check blocked/blocking tickets, required services
1. **Risk Assessment**: Complexity estimation, identify blockers

## Integration Notes

- Create TodoWrite list with backend-first steps
- MANDATORY: ASK before transitioning JIRA tickets
